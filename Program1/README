The three files will work with the given test.cpp. I come into an error with the stress test when i = 110.
I tried to debug this and saw that the list was only a sentinel and one node value of 21. I tested my sort 
code with as many different possibilities as I could such as only one element with a sentinel node(the problem) 
and random numbered lists but I could not come across any problems with the merge sort when using the non-macro file I have.
It is difficult to work with the macro version to see EXACTLY what is wrong. Please let me know if you see what im doing wrong!!
Thanks a lot,

Evan
